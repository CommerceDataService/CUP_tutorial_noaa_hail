####> intro
Hail storms can cause harm to people and property. This R tutorial with  leaflet.js + Google Charts integration focuses on getting started with NOAA's severe weather data to assess and map hail risk around the US.

####> objective
Using various pattern detection methods, train and evaluate models against hundreds of county-level, monthly-level statistics to assess the feasibility of monitoring key metrics for near real-time tracking.

####> milestones
- **November 2015**: 
  - Initial data collection using VIIRS monthly composites, discussions with NOAA
  - Collection of multiple county level data sources from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Energy Information Administration
  - Iterative model training 
- **December 2015**:
  - Reveal first findings, discussions on production possibilities

####> code
This repository contains:
- An annotated R script of the data processing steps
- A number of wrappers for extracting data from the NOAA Severe Weather Data Inventory's API
