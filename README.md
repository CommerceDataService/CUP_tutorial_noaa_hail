- R code: https://github.com/CommerceDataService/tutorial_noaa_hail/tree/gh-pages/tutorial_files

####> intro
Hail storms can cause harm to people and property. This R tutorial with  leaflet.js + Google Charts integration focuses on getting started with NOAA's severe weather data to assess and map hail risk around the US.

####> objective
- Demonstrate how to process, visualize and use NOAA's Severe Weather Data Inventory (SWDI -- https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdi/) in order to understand weather risks, particularly hail. Methods can be expanded to other events such as tornados.

####> milestones
- **October 2015**: 
  - Collaborate with NOAA NCEI on initial data usage, review
  - Develop R processing code for API calls, processing, maps
- **November 2015**:
  - Produce v1.0 tutorial on processing hail climatologies

####> code
This repository contains:
- An annotated R script of the data processing steps
- A number of wrappers for extracting data from the NOAA Severe Weather Data Inventory's API
